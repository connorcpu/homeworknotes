Airframe has different definitions based on the air plane
- air- or spacecraft without installed equipment or furnishing
- the skin and framework that provide the aerodynamic shapes
- the lead bearing parts that take up forces during flight
- the parts that together protect the contents from the environment

Primary structures are structural elements that in case of failure or damage could lead to total failure  
secondary structures are structural elements that are non-critical such as carrying aerodynamic or inertial loads

## structural concepts 

### truss structures
uses diagonals to create a rigid primary structure, the skin does not contribute. 
Furthermore, wires were used to great extend in tension, rods for compression or tension

### shell structures
sheets can be used to reinforce a structure, thin-walled shell structures take loads is shear instead of compression or tension.
Shell structures can perform 4 functions:
- compressive strength
- tensile strength
- shear strength 
- sealing
it is worth noting sheets in compression require reinforcement to prevent deformation. Geometric reinforcement is also an option, by folding the sheet it wont deform.
- hat stiffeners
- L-stiffeners
- Z-stiffeners
hat stiffeners are square folds in a sheet, while the dont allow internal inspection they are able to carry more load compared to L-stiffeners.  
L-stiffeners are a 90 bend to the back of a sheet. L-stiffeners provide significantly less structural reinforcement compared to hat stiffeners.  
Since a stiffener has a limited and local effect the effective width should be considered to determine spacing.
In a beam girders can be used as stiffeners to reinforce the web-plate which is providing diagonal function (I.E. carrying shear loads), where the girders carry compressive and tensile loads.

### sandwich structures
Sandwich structures are two sheets with a core in-between. The two sheets provide tensile and compressive strength similar to girders while the low density core carrys shear loads.
An example of the core is a honeycomb pattern.
Sandwich structures have high bending stiffness which is why they are usually used in the floors of passenger and cargo areas.
While sandwich structures seem ideal they have a tendency to absorb moisture leading to corrosion or failure when frozen.
In addition sandwich structures are difficult to join together with other elements because the soft core is not able to carry the bearing load induced by bolt causing the faces to delaminate from the core.
Other bolting techniques also provide challenges.

### integrally stiffened structures
This is when a sheet is stiffened. Stiffeners can either be bolted, riveted or bonded.
Alternatively a thick plate can be machined down to a thin plate with stiffeners using a mill.
Integrally stiffened structures provide relative low cost of production at high volume with a low amount of parts.
Milled away scrap is not an issue as it can be reused.
Milling proves the advantage of continuously optimized thickness at the drawback of not being able to produce more complex stiffener geometry.
Integrally stiffened structures are made from one single component, because this is not a build-up structure it is considered less damage-tolerant because it lacks natural barriers to stop propagating cracks.


## fuselage structures 

A fuselage consist of several elements:
- fuselage skin 
- frames
- stringers
- bulkheads
- splices and joints

Within a fuselage the longitudinal stiffness is created in part by the geometry of the fuselage but primarily by stringers applied to skin panels.
Alternatively stringers can be combined into longerons (heavy longitudinal stringers that can carry larger loads), this means less stringers will be required however the longerons have a larger cross-section.
Bulkheads need to be applied to the front and rear of an aircraft if it is to be pressurized.

## wing structures

Wing structures can be divided into:
- wing skin panels 
- ribs
- spars

### spars
Spars run lengthwise from root to wing tip, sometimes with a kink in the middle, which is manufactured by joining two spars together.
Spars can be extremely long since wings can get very long, because of this wings are sometimes sectioned off to make manufacturing easier.
Sectioning can however lead to highly loaded joints.
A spars main function is to carry the wings bending load.
Basic spars are often I-beams because the web-plates can carry the diagonals very well while the girders resist the normal forces.
Wing roots carry more load than wing tips despite deforming less.
As a result the I-beam must be thicker near the wing root, this is however impossible given normal manufacturing techniques (extrusion), hence several other techniques have developed.
Once such techniques is to create the girders and web-plate separately before joining them via for example riveting.
Alternatively a constant thickness spar is extruded and subsequently reinforced with additional material.
Similarly to ribs different spar designs can be considered for different functions.

### ribs
Ribs may run perpendicular to the wing spar(s) or in the flight direction in the case of swept wings.
Ribs provide:
- the wings adherence to the wing profile
- transference of aerodynamic or fuel loads to the rest of the structure
- proper distance between upper and lower skin, preventing buckling, crushing and preserving the wing shape

Proper spacing is mandatory with ribs.
Since every wing could have different loads attributed to it any rib may be individually designed.
