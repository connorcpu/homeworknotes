## |450 - 1066| axnglo-saxon period (old english period)

### poltics & society
the original inhabitats of the english iles where the celts. they lived in tribes and were knows as barbaric fighters.
they fought naked with blue body paint. the decapitated their victims and placed their heads on poles in front of their houses.
They had greek wine and chariots which means they traded with the mainland.
the celts were great fighters but they lost to the romans, who stayed from 43AD to 410AD. they built roads, theatres and they collected taxes. they didnt live here however.
the celts were still there when the romans left, but from 450AD onward they were invaded by germanic tribes from north-germany and denmark, undermore the angles, saxons and jutes.
these tribes killed the celts so they fled to scottland, whales and ireland. The jutes dont appear in history thereafter so the were most likely integrated into anglo-saxon society.
The anglo-saxon were then invaded by the vikings called the danes from scandinavia and north-denmark. at first they just raided for silver and gold. but from 793AD onward 
they also settled in a place called danelaw. until 1042 there is a lot of scandinavian influence, until the anglo-saxon king dies, harold godwinson and william of normandy claim the throne.
william beat godwinson in the battle of hastings in 1066, starting the anglo-norman period also known as the middle english period.

#### alfred the great (847-899)
alfred was king of wessex (871 - 886) and king of the anglo-saxons (886-899). he spent several years fighting viking invasions. he won the battle of edington in 878
and made an agreement with the vikings, creating danelaw in the north of england. he also oversaw that the viking leader was converted to christianity. 
Alfred is the dude that made sure all boys could go to school and that school was taught in anglo-saxon instead of latin.
