 Despite both the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy and the rosie project being comiedic novels the two are very diffrent
despite reading very similar, something I find very strange and interesting. The hitch hikers guide to the galaxy tells 
the story of how a very normal british gentelman gets forcably dragged into a space adventure with his long time friend 
that turns out to be an alien. The rosie project tells a very diffrent story of a very puncutal, systematic and rational 
genetesist that gets dragged into irrational journey as he falls in love without realizing it.

 The first book the hichhikers guide to the galaxy begins very simply as the first line of 
the book will tell you, however things quickly devolve and a perfectly normal british 
Arthur Dent gets forced into a space adventure with his long time friend ford. Arthur 
ABSOLUTLY did not plan or want to go into this adventure however he is forced to and ends
up being somewhat comfortable with it in the end. the rosie project on the other hand tells
a story that at first glance seems very diffrent, however looking just slightly below the
surface we can see it share a suprising lot with mr. adams' book. The Rosie Project is 
about a genetisit called don tillman, don is a precise man who makes rational decisions and 
never lets emotions take over, furthermore it is worth mentioning that Don does not realize 
that he has autism or rather aspergers syndrome. At the start of the book don decides it is time for
a partner is his life, however things do not go quite to plan. His plan was simple: set up 
a questionair to look for traids and characteristics in woman to access if they would form
a suitable partner, unsuprisingly to the reader but completly baffeling to don he is 
unsuccessfull. After having form his questionair his friend gene decides to make a recomendation.
enter rosie, rosie is NOT compatable acording to almost every single criteria set by the questionair
however after finding out rosie doesn't know who her biological father is he decides to help.
after a while don find it hard to justifie helping rosie, however he keeps at it slowly losing
grip of his emotions, schedual and his view of the world.

 The hichhikers guide is writen very carefully, keeping knowlage and explination from the reader
despite this not being conventional the book executes it masterfully in my opinon. Because the reader
doesn't quite get what is going at all times the book makes you see the events from the protaginsts view
as Arthur also doesn't have a clue about what is happening to him, despite ford seemly having a firm
grasp on things and sometimes getting agitated at Arthur for not understanding. in my opinion this is

as Arthur also doesn't have a clue about what is happening to him, despite ford seemly having a firm
grasp on things and sometimes getting agitated at Arthur for not understanding. in my opinion this is 
perfect for the story as you understand as much as the protaginist and see everything from his point of view
thinking precisly what Arthur was thinking at that exact moment. The Rosie Project also shows you the world as 
Don sees it. don's thoughts are writen down, although it doesn't make you think and feel the same as the protagnist
the book comunicates don's "feelings" and thoughts exeptonaly well through how each sentence is contruced, picking
phrases such as "i informed her" instead of "i told her" when Don is simply stating a fact. This way of writing
though subtle makes you see the protagnist thinking pattern and how exact, calculated and rational he is, and 
how this is devolving over the course of the book. More instances of this can be found on every line such as 
"i demonstrated" instead of "i showed", everytime a new charcter is introduced Don makes estimates of their age, 
length and bmi but also sentences such as "i open my wallet and extracted my credit card"
the use of the word extract shows how don thinks, he doesn't grab or get his credit card he extracts it.

 Throughout his journey traveling the galaxy Arthur dent has one constant to hold on to his friends: ford,
zephod and trillian these characters plan an important role in the story as they guide our protaganist. 
Without his friends Arthur would be lost in a confusing place left to fight for himself. This best describes
Ford however zephod a lot less as he serves as a sample of the outside world because he is not from earth
however this needs to be moderated and reduced for Arthur and the reader to understand one bite-sized-bit at
a time. This is the exact purpose of Trillian, in in between to serve as a railing for arthur to hold on to while
on his journey. The fact that trillain is also from earth and has already gained an understading of everything only
makes her fit better. In The Rosie Project however the friend group is rather limited due to Don's distinct lack of social
skills, neverthenless every "friend" has a very distinct purpose in Don's life. First on the list is claudia, it is fairly
simple to decypher her purpose, that is to serve as don's therapist and to give him advice on (social) things he doesn't
understand. Don's often visits claudia in times of need and she happily helps him on his way. Gene however is a bit more 
tricky. Gene is Don's closest friend and they see each other very often due to working together, therfore Gene is one
of the only characters that doesn't have to schedule a conversation and because of this i believe Gene serves as 
Don's window into the real world however the book firmly astablishes Gene is not accurate which Don cant tell.
Gene is important to the story because he pushes Don out of his comfort zone as proven by Gene being the one to
sugest Rosie as a partner, however due to Gene's inreliablity Don has to figure much out on his own and when he gets 
stuck on something and needs help he can visit claudia for advice on the matter. 

 Both book are very diffrent on first glance but looking closer they are remarkably similair. Disregarding the
fact that Don WAS planing on getting a partner and Arthur was NOT planning on going on an adventure, both 
protaganists had no idea what "the universe" had in store for them and they were extremly confused by the events
that very much happend to them without them expecting any of it. In both books you view the world from the point of
view of the protagnist exprencing everything like they are, this is achived through slightly diffrent methods, in 
The Hich Hikers Guide To The Galaxy this is done through keeping information from you and the protaganist making you
as confused as Arthur. While The Rosie project leans more on its first person writing style and a very specific word 
choise. I greatly enjoyed reading both books with the only minor issue being that someone recomended The Rosie Project
because I might recognize myself in the protaginist and the author stated that his research of autism consisted of
working in IT for 10 years which is sort of upsetting for me personly
