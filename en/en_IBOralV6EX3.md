   the mother said it was very hard to leave ukraine but she says everyone wants what is best for their children even if she had to leave her husband and son 
   on freedom avenue
   'literally suported by her fellow ukrainians'
   she represents the joy and beauty the soldiers are fighting for in an ugly war
  
   the second cover is of a soldier evacuating a mother and child
   facing left/east, away from russia

literrary:
   it shows the suffering people have to endure under the rule of people who only care about power or control.
   A blatant disregard for the humanity and emotions of fellow human beings.

Seemingly careless of the effect of his words on the carefully constructed and fragile constitution of the family's life, Hashim began to gush, to spume long streams of awful truths.
In horrified silence, his children heard their father turn upon his wife, and reveal to her that for many years their marriage had been the worst of his afflictions.
'An end to politeness!' he thundered.
'An end to hypocrisy!' Next, and in the same spirit, he revealed to his family the existence of a mistress; he informed them also of his regular visits to paid women.
He told his wife that, far from being the principal beneficiary of his will, she would receive no more than the eighth portion which was her due under Islamic law.
Then he turned upon his children, screaming at Atta for his lack of academic ability-'A dope! I have been cursed with a dope!'--and accusing his daughter of lasciviousness, because she went around the city barefaced, which was unseemly for any good Muslim girl to do.
She should, he com- manded, enter purdah' forthwith.
Hashim left the table without having eaten and fell into the deep sleep of a man who has got many things off his chest, leaving his children stunned, in tears, and the dinner going cold on the sideboard under the gaze of an anticipatory bearer." At five o'clock the next morning the moneylender forced his family to rise, wash and say their prayers.
From then on, he began to pray five times daily for the first time in his life, and his wife and children were obliged to do likewise.
Before breakfast, Huma saw the servants, under her father's direction, constructing a great heap of books in the garden and setting fire to it.
The only volume left untouched was the Qur'an, which Hashim wrapped in a silken cloth and placed on a table in the hall.
He ordered each member of his family to read passages from this book for at least two hours per day.
Visits to the cinema were forbidden.
And if Atta invited male friends to the house, Huma was to retire to her room.
By now, the family had entered a state of shock and dismay; but there was worse to come.
That afternoon, a trembling debtor arrived at the house to confess his inability to pay the latest instalment of interest owed, and made the mistake of reminding Hashim, in somewhat blustering fashion, of the Qur'an's stric- tures against usury.
The moneylender flew into a rage and attacked the fellow with one of his large collection of bullwhips.
By mischance, later the same day a second defaulter came to plead for time, and was seen fleeing Hashim's study with a great gash in his arm, because Huma's father had called him a thief of other men's money and had tried to cut off the wretch's right hand with one of the thirty-eight kukri knives' hanging on the study walls.
