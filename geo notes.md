# RUSIA ch.7

## paragraph 1
### climate 
cold due to
1. large land mass far east
2. very far north
3. high mountain range in the south holding back warm air

### **soil** 

**eluviation** is when little rain evaporates and the rest sinks into the soil taking to nutriens making the soil infertile
**hardpan** is a solid layer of podzol inpenerable by water making the ground unsuiteable for agraculture

black earth is has a thick layer of **humus** made of decomposing grass

### **permafrost**
the heat of a houes can melt through permafost making the house sing. this can be solved with pile foundation

### **transport problems on land**
in the summer driving is very bad
because melting snow and ice can't be drained and the entire coutryside turn into mud. on alphalted roads this in not too bad
 
### **transport problems in water**
- most rivers flow south-to-north and are rain-fed in russia
in the summer there is a lot evaporation, causing low water 
levels problematic for shipping.
- most good need to be transported from west-to-east so the rivers can't be used eficiently
- in the south the water melts first and then flows north but up north the water is still frozen so drainage is poor, which causes flooding

## paragraph 2
russia was inhabited mainly by poor farmers. in 1917 a revolution was started and the USSR started and it was communist

### **planned economy**
after the revolution the state decided everything what was produced, how land was used and where everyone worked. there was no compition on the market, and only one goal: meet the production target the state had set.

### **and today?**
after the colapsle of communism it was hard to make the swich to a free market and poverty and crime increased, however today russia is developing fast as one of the four BRIC countries but it still depends too much on natural resources of which prices fluctuate too much

### **demographic time bomb**
the swich to a free market was hard for russia resulting in a lot of crime and poverty which meant a high mortality rate and a low birth rate these numbers are slowly being corrected. the high mortalaty rate means a low life expectancy of 65 for a man just a few years ago in russia.
a lot of people are imigrating from coutries that became independed after the revolution

## paragraph 3

### **Ukraine, a powder keg**
ukraine became independed after the revolution this made russia unhappy because ukraine could develop miltariy ties with western europe so russia tries to retain infulance there.
ukraine also has the crimean peninsula with is strategically important for russia.
in the east, ukraine is a lot like russia but in the west, ukraine is a lot like western europe. in 2013 ukrain wanted closer connections with the EU but crimea's inhabitants were divided so russians occupied crimea. after the majority of crimea voted to be a part of russia, the army remained there.

### **natural gas**
russia suplies a lot of gas to europe. half of the pipes that transport gas travel through ukraine. russia can cut of ukrains gas which also cuts of most of europes gas. europe does not want that so the nord stream was constructed to pipe gas through sea.

## paragraph 4

### **at first**
at first the aral sea was an inland sea the size of the benelux, due to extrema evaporation and low amounts of rainfall most water came from the syr darya and amu darya rivers.
the population earned a living mostly through fishing

### **impactfull decisions**
the sovjet union decided to redirect both rivers to iragate coton fields
the water was transported long distances and a lot evaporated or leaked before it arived.
eventualy one of the rivers dried up completely and the other dropped to a very low water level

### **effects**
the sea level dropped a lot. a large part of the sea turned to desert with rusting boats in them. the pestisides used by the farmers have been found in ground and drink water making people sick. most of the aral sea is unsuitable for farming due to salt and toxicity. there isn't enough food for people. and the salt levels rose and killed a lot of the fish. the climate is affected due the there being no sea climate without a sea.
