MATH chaper 2 year 3: similarity

2.1
    in a ratio table cross products are equal
    2 | 5
    ------    2*25=50 | 10*5=50 | x=2 (10*5)/25
    10| 25   

    in a ratio table with multiple colums every cross needs to satisfy theory 1
    e.g.
    10|16|18    colums 1 and 2 need to satisfy theory 1  10*24=16*15
    --------    colums 2 and 3 need to satisfy theory 1  16*27=24*18
    15|24|27    colums 1 and 3 need to satisfy theory 1  15*18=10*27
               
    when two lines radiate from a central point this is know as central projection
    when paralel lines are drawn between the two lines you can assume that there is a ratio
    between the space between the top points of two lines and the space between the bottom 
    two points of the same lines: assume two non-paralel lines are present, assume point a, 
    point b and point c are on one line and point A, point B and point C are on the other assume that A is further from the 
    central point than point B and that a is closer than point b etc. the ratio tabel is as follows
    AB|BC
    -----
    ab|bc

2.2
    in ratioed triangles all angels are the same and all side have the same scale factor

    assume there are 3 lines 2 of these are paralel the other intersecst both
    in a Z shape the two acute angels are the same degrees
    in a F shape one angel on the inside of the shape is the same as one on the outside

    the angels in a triangle add to 180 degrees

    CRITERIA FOR SIMILARITY
        1. (AA)  2 angels that are the same in the other triangle 
        2. (SSS) every side has the same scale factor in relation with the other triangle
        3. (SAS) 1 angel that lines up and the two side that meet there have the same scale factor
        4. (SSR) 1 right angel in both triangles and equal scale factor on the hypotonuese and one of the legs
    S=side
    A=angel
    R=right angel

2.5
    a midsegment is a segment of a line that goes from the middel of one side of a triangle to the middel of another side of the triangle

    a median is a segment of a line that goes from the middel of one side of a triangle to a corner of the same triangle

    when the two medians of AQ and BR intersect at point G RG:CG=1:2
