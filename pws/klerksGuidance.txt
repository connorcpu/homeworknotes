Title:
   A greener jet engine - what is the most environmentally friendly way to improve the efficiency of a jet engine?
Primary question:
  what is the most environmentally friendly way to improve the efficiency of a jet engine? 
sub-questions:
   - efficiency (how do we calculate efficiency)
   - fuels (different fuels that could be used)
   - building materials (what materials could we use)
action plan: 
   1. Do research into how a modern jet engine functions
   2. See how we could improve on that design 
   3. Review different potential fuels 
   4. Choose a fuel and create a design
